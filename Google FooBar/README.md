The Google Foobar challenge is a 5 round invitational coding challenge testing mainly algorithmic knowledge. 
The problems in higher rounds are pretty fun with round 5 consisting of a single problem with a 22 day time limit.
After successfully completing the challenge I was given an encrypted message and allowed to request and try new level 5 problems. 

In this repo I have uploaded some of my solutions to various problems asked in the challenge, notably there are two number 5 problems 
in this set along with the solution to the encrypted message Google sends when you complete the challenge. More solutions may be added as I refactor old files.

The problem statements are commented on top of the respective solution, but my favorite problem is below.

Given a positive integer N bounded above by googol (10^100), find the sum of the sequence x_k =  floor( k * sqrt(2) ) as k ranges from 0 to N.
