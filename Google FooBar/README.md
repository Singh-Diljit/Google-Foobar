# Google FooBar

**This code is not indicitive of where I have been for the last 5+ years.**
The Google Foobar challenge is a 5 round invitational coding challenge testing mainly algorithmic knowledge. It was my first introduction to coding (although I had been interested in algorithms for many years before this.)

The problems in higher rounds are pretty fun with round 5 consisting of a single problem with a 22 day time limit.
After successfully completing the challenge I was given an encrypted message, which is included. 

In this repo I have uploaded some of my solutions to various problems asked in the challenge, notably there are two number 5 problems. After succesfully completing the challange you can test new 'level 5' problems - which I have included.

The problem statements are commented on top of the respective solution, but my favorite problem is below:

Given a positive integer N bounded above by googol (10^100), find the sum of the sequence $x_k = \left\lfloor k*\sqrt(2) \right\rfloor$ as $k$ ranges from $0$ to $N$.
