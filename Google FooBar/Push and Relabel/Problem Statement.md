PROBELM STATEMENT


Write a function solution(entrances, exits, path) that
takes an array of integers denoting where the groups of
gathered bunnies are, an array of integers denoting where
the escape pods are located, and an array of an array of
integers of the corridors, returning the total number of
bunnies that can get through at each time step as an int.
The entrances and exits are disjoint and thus will never
overlap. The path element path[A][B] = C describes that
the corridor going from A to B can fit C bunnies at each time step.
